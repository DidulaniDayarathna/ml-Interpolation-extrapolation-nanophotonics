The need for numerical modeling is central for the understanding, control, and design of plasmonic and photonic nanostructures. Recently, the increasing sophistication of nanophotonic systems and processes, ranging from simple plasmonic nanostructures to multiscale and complex photonic devices, has been calling for highly efficient numerical simulation tools. This article reviews the state of the art in numerical methods for nanophotonics and describes which method is the best suited for specific problems. The widespread approaches derived from classical electrodynamics such as finite differences in time domain, finite elements, surface integral, volume integral, and hybrid methods are reviewed and illustrated by application examples. Their potential for efficient simulation of nanophotonic systems, such as those involving light propagation, localization, scattering, or multiphysical systems is assessed. The numerical modeling of complex systems including nonlinearity, nonlocal and quantum effects as well as new materials such as graphene is discussed in the perspective of actual and future challenges for computational nanophotonics.

The method was originally developed for mechanical design problems but has within the last six years been applied to a range of photonics applications. Topology optimization may be based on finite element and finite difference type modeling methods in both frequency and time domain. The basic idea is that the material density of each element or grid point is a design variable, hence the geometry is parameterized in a pixel-like fashion. The optimization problem is efficiently solved using mathematical programming-based optimization methods and analytical gradient calculations. The paper reviews the basic procedures behind topology optimization, a large number of applications ranging from photonic crystal design to surface plasmonic devices, and lists some of the future challenges in non-linear applications. {\textcopyright} 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

Originally applied almost exclusively in computer-science areas such as image analysis and nature language processing, deep learning has rapidly entered a wide variety of scientific fields including physics, chemistry and material science. Very recently, deep neural networks have been introduced in the field of nanophotonics as a powerful way of obtaining the nonlinear mapping between the topology and composition of arbitrary nanophotonic structures and their associated functional properties. In this paper, we have discussed the recent progress in the application of deep learning to the inverse design of nanophotonic devices, mainly focusing on the three existing learning paradigms of supervised-, unsupervised-, and reinforcement learning.

Materials discovery and optimization is one such field, but significant challenges remain, including the requirement of large labeled datasets and one-to-many mapping that arises in solving the inverse problem. Here we demonstrate modeling of complex all-dielectric metasurface systems with deep neural networks, using both the metasurface geometry and knowledge of the underlying physics as inputs. Our deep learning network is highly accurate, achieving an average mean square error of only 1.16 $\backslash${\&}$\backslash${\#}x000D7; 10$\backslash${\&}$\backslash${\#}x02212;3 and is over five orders of magnitude faster than conventional electromagnetic simulation software.

We investigate the colour generation by dielectric nanostructures and show that this model can find geometrical properties that can generate much purer red, green and blue colours compared to previously reported results.

A key feature of the network is that it initially generates a distribution of devices that broadly samples the design space and then shifts and refines this distribution toward favorable design space regions over the course of optimization. Training is performed by calculating the forward and adjoint electromagnetic simulations of outputted devices and using the subsequent efficiency gradients for backpropagation. With metagratings operating across a range of wavelengths and angles as a model system, we show that devices produced from the trained generative network have efficiencies comparable to or better than the best devices produced by adjoint-based topology optimization, while requiring less computational cost. Our reframing of adjoint-based optimization to the training of a generative neural network applies generally to physical systems that can utilize gradients to improve performance.},

In contrast, the inverse problem, i.e., obtaining a geometry for a desired electromagnetic response, remains a challenging and time-consuming task within the boundaries of very specific assumptions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that a novel Deep Neural Network trained with thousands of synthetic experiments is not only able to retrieve subwavelength dimensions from solely far-field measurements but is also capable of directly addressing the inverse problem. Our approach allows the rapid design and characterization of metasurface-based optical elements as well as optimal nanostructures for targeted chemicals and biomolecules, which are critical for sensing, imaging and integrated spectroscopy applications.},

The design of on-demand graphene-based metamaterials often calls for the solution of a complex inverse problem within a small sampling space, which highly depends on the rich experiences from researchers of nanophotonics. Conventional optimization algorithms could be used for this inverse design, but they converge to local optimal solutions and take significant computational costs with increased nanostructure parameters. Here, we establish a deep learning method based on an adaptive batch-normalized neural network, aiming to implement smart and rapid inverse design for graphene-based metamaterials with on-demand optical responses. This method allows a quick converging speed with high precision and low computational consumption. As typical complex proof-of-concept examples, the optical metamaterials consisting of graphene/dielectric alternating multilayers are chosen to demonstrate the validity of our design paradigm. Our method demonstrates a high prediction accuracy of over 95{\%} after very few training epochs. A universal programming package is developed to achieve the design goals of graphene-based metamaterials with low absorption and near unity absorption, respectively. Our work may find important design applications in the field of nanoscale photonics based on graphene and other 2D materials.},

@article{Jiang20191,
abstract = {A key challenge in metasurface design is the development of algorithms that can effectively and efficiently produce high-performance devices. Design methods based on iterative optimization can push the performance limits of metasurfaces, but they require extensive computational resources that limit their implementation to small numbers of microscale devices. We show that generative neural networks can train from images of periodic, topology-optimized metagratings to produce high-efficiency, topologically complex devices operating over a broad range of deflection angles and wavelengths. Further iterative optimization of these designs yields devices with enhanced robustness and efficiencies, and these devices can be utilized as additional training data for network refinement. In this manner, generative networks can be trained, with a one-time computation cost, and used as a design tool to facilitate the production of near-optimal, topologically complex device designs. We envision that such data-driven design methodologies can apply to other physical sciences domains that require the design of functional elements operating across a wide parameter space.},

@article{Malkiel2020,
abstract = {The past decade has witnessed the advent of nanophotonics, where light-matter interaction is shaped, almost at will, with human-made designed nanostructures. However, the design process for these nanostructures has remained complex, often relying on the intuition and expertise of the designer, ultimately limiting the reach and penetration of this groundbreaking approach. Recently, there has been an increasing number of studies in applying machine learning techniques for the design of nanostructures. Most of these studies engage deep learning techniques, which entail training a deep neural network (DNN) to approximate the highly nonlinear function of the underlying physical process of the interaction between light and the nanostructures. At the end of the training, the DNN allows for on-demand design of nanostructures (i.e., the model can infer nanostructure geometries for desired light spectra). In this article, we review previous studies for designing nanostructures, including recent advances where a DNN is trained to generate a two-dimensional image of the designed nanostructure, which is not limited to a closed set of nanostructure shapes, and can be trained for the design of any geometry. This allows for better generalization, with higher applicability for real-world design problems.},

@inproceedings{Melati2020,
abstract = {Enabled by technological improvements, photonic devices and circuits are becoming increasingly more complex. Non-trivial geometries are designed to reduce device footprint, improve performance, and introduce novel func- tionalities. However, the number of design variables required to properly represent these geometries quickly grows, limiting the effectiveness of classical design approaches. Moreover, parameters are often strongly inter- dependent, restricting the use of sequential optimizations or independent parameter sweeps. Although several optimization techniques can be effective for multi-parameter design, they commonly allow to optimize for a single or a handful designs and the optimization process needs to be repeated if new performance criteria are introduced. In contrast to classical design approaches, the influences of the design parameters remain hidden as well as the general behavior of the design space. In this paper we present an extension of our recent work on the application of machine learning pattern recognition to the design of multi-parameter photonic devices. In particular, we propose using a combination of local optimization based on the adjoint method and the use of dimensionality reduction. Adjoint optimization is used multiple times to generate a small set of different designs with high performance. Dimensionality reduction is applied to analyze the relationship between these degener- ate designs and identify a lower-dimensional design sub-space that includes all alternative good designs. This sub-space can be mapped for any performance criteria thus enabling informed decisions based on the relative pri- orities of all relevant performance specifications. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate a ten-parameter design of an integrated photonic power splitter using silicon-on-insulator technology. We identify a region of possible high performance design solutions and select two design candidates either maximizing the splitter efficiency or minimizing back-reflection},

@article{Asano2018,
abstract = {An approach to optimizing the Q factors of two-dimensional photonic crystal (2D-PC) nanocavities based on deep learning is proposed and demonstrated. We prepare a dataset consisting of 1000 nanocavities generated by randomly displacing the positions of many air holes of a base nanocavity and their Q factors calculated by a first-principle method. We train a four-layer neural network including a convolutional layer to recognize the relationship between the air holes' displacements and the Q factors using the prepared dataset. After the training, the neural network becomes able to estimate the Q factors from the air holes' displacements with an error of 13{\%} in standard deviation. Crucially, the trained neural network can estimate the gradient of the Q factor with respect to the air holes' displacements very quickly based on back-propagation. A nanocavity structure with an extremely high Q factor of 1.58 x 10{\^{}}9 is successfully obtained by optimizing the positions of 50 air holes over {\~{}}10{\^{}}6 iterations, having taken advantage of the very fast evaluation of the gradient in high-dimensional parameter space. The obtained Q factor is more than one order of magnitude higher than that of the base cavity and more than twice that of the highest Q factors reported so far for cavities with similar modal volumes. This approach can optimize 2D-PC structures over a parameter space of a size unfeasibly large for previous optimization methods based solely on direct calculations. We believe this approach is also useful for improving other optical characteristics.},

@article{Inampudi2018,
abstract = {Metagratings are flat and thin surfaces that rely on unique, periodically repeating (non-gradient), arbitrary shaped light scattering units for wave manipulation. However, the absence of an empirical relationship between the structural and diffraction properties of the units enforces utilization of brute force numerical optimization techniques to determine the unit shape for a desired application. Here, we present an artificial neural network based methodology to develop a fast-paced numerical relationship between the two. We demonstrate the training and the performance of a numerical function, utilizing simulated diffraction efficiencies of a large set of units, that can instantaneously mimic the optical response of any other arbitrary shaped unit of the same class. We validate the performance of the trained neural network on a previously unseen set of test samples and discuss the statistical significance. We then utilize the virtually instantaneous network operations to inverse design the metagrating unit shapes for a desired diffraction efficiency distribution. The proposed inter-disciplinary combination of advanced information processing techniques with Maxwell's equation solvers opens a pathway for the fast-paced prediction of metagrating designs rather than full wave computation.},

The Fano resonance and plasmon-induced transparency effect originated from the PWCCS have been selected as illustrations to verify the effectiveness of ANNs. We use the genetic algorithm to design the network architecture and select the hyperparameters for ANNs. Once ANNs are trained by using a small sampling of the data generated by the Monte Carlo method, the transmission spectra predicted by the ANNs are quite approximate to the simulated results. The physical mechanisms behind the phenomena are discussed theoretically, and the uncertain parameters in the theoretical models are fitted by utilizing the trained ANNs. More importantly, our results demonstrate that this model-driven method not only realizes the inverse design of the PWCCS with high precision but also optimizes some critical performance metrics for the transmission spectrum. Compared with previous works, we construct a novel model-driven analysis method for the PWCCS that is expected to have significant applications in the device design, performance optimization, variability analysis, defect detection, theoretical modeling, optical interconnects, and so on.},

DIMs are deep neural networks (i.e.{,} deep learning models) that are specially-designed to solve ill-posed inverse problems. There has recently been tremendous growth in the use of DIMs for solving AEM design problems however there has been little comparison of these approaches to examine their absolute and relative performance capabilities. In this work we compare eight state-of-the-art DIMs on three unique AEM design problems{,} including two models that are novel to the AEM community. Our results indicate that DIMs can rapidly produce accurate designs to achieve a custom desired scattering on all three problems. Although no single model always performs best{,} the Neural-Adjoint approach achieves the best overall performance across all problem settings. As a final contribution we show that not all AEM design problems are ill-posed{,} and in such cases a conventional deep neural network can perform better than DIMs. We recommend that a deep neural network is always employed as a simple baseline approach when addressing AEM design problems. We publish python code for our AEM simulators and our DIMs to enable easy replication of our results{,} and benchmarking of new DIMs by the AEM community."}

@article{Getman2021,
abstract = {Integrating conventional optics into compact nanostructured surfaces is the goal of flat optics. Despite the enormous progress in this technology, there are still critical challenges for real-world applications due to the limited operational efficiency in the visible region, on average lower than 60{\%}, which originates from absorption losses in wavelength-thick (≈ 500 nm) structures. Another issue is the realization of on-demand optical components for controlling vectorial light at visible frequencies simultaneously in both reflection and transmission and with a predetermined wavefront shape. In this work, we developed an inverse design approach that allows the realization of highly efficient (up to 99{\%}) ultrathin (down to 50 nm thick) optics for vectorial light control with broadband input–output responses in the visible and near-IR regions with a desired wavefront shape. The approach leverages suitably engineered semiconductor nanostructures, which behave as a neural network that can approximate a user-defined input–output function. Near-unity performance results from the ultrathin nature of these surfaces, which reduces absorption losses to near-negligible values. Experimentally, we discuss polarizing beam splitters, comparing their performance with the best results obtained from both direct and inverse design techniques, and new flat-optics components represented by dichroic mirrors and the basic unit of a flat-optics display that creates full colours by using only two subpixels, overcoming the limitations of conventional LCD/OLED technologies that require three subpixels for each composite colour. Our devices can be manufactured with a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible process, making them scalable for mass production at low cost.},

@article{Kiarashinejad2020,
abstract = {In this paper, we demonstrate a computationally efficient new approach based on deep learning (DL) techniques for analysis, design and optimization of electromagnetic (EM) nanostructures. We use the strong correlation among features of a generic EM problem to considerably reduce the dimensionality of the problem and thus, the computational complexity, without imposing considerable errors. By employing the dimensionality reduction concept using the more recently demonstrated autoencoder technique, we redefine the conventional many-to-one design problem in EM nanostructures into a one-to-one problem plus a much simpler many-to-one problem, which can be simply solved using an analytic formulation. This approach reduces the computational complexity in solving both the forward problem (i.e., analysis) and the inverse problem (i.e., design) by orders of magnitude compared to conventional approaches. In addition, it provides analytic formulations that, despite their complexity, can be used to obtain intuitive understanding of the physics and dynamics of EM wave interaction with nanostructures with minimal computation requirements. As a proof-of-concept, we applied such an efficacious method to design a new class of on-demand reconfigurable optical metasurfaces based on phase-change materials (PCMs). The experimental results of the fabricated devices are in good agreement with those predicted by the proposed approach. We envision that the integration of such a DL-based technique with full-wave commercial software packages offers a powerful toolkit to facilitate the analysis, design, and optimization of the EM nanostructures as well as explaining, understanding, and predicting the observed responses in such structures. It will thus enable to solve complex design problems that could not be solved with existing techniques.},
